# PoShFailedLoginReport
Script will parse a domain controller security log for failed logon attempts and output those failures to an html file

very useful if you have users that are continually being locked out of their accounts due to multiple logons from mobile devices, laptops, desktops, etc.

Good replacement for using lockedout or other apps to generate the same report.

I didn't create this script but am happy to share it.
